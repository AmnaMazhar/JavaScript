## Difference between JS Variables

There are **3 ways** to declare a **JS Variable**.

1. var
2. const
3. let

# var

-

# const

- You must initialize them when you declare them.

   `const myName = "Amna Mazhar";`
   
 - You can't assign them a new value after you've initialized them.
 
# let

- You can declare a variable without initializing it.

   `let myName;`
   
   `myName = "Amna Mazhar";`
   
 - You can re-assign them a new value after you've initialized them.
    
   `let myName = "Amna Mazhar";`
   
   `myName = "Amna";`
